Its small size and flexibility make it popular in embedded devices.\n\nAn out-of-bounds heap read in `unlzma` leads to information leak and denial of service when crafted LZMA-compressed input is decompressed. This can be triggered by any applet/format that internally supports LZMA compression.\nAn attacker that can pass an LZMA-based archive to be decompressed, can cause data leakage and denial of service.\nNote that the following applets all accept and decompress an LZMA-based archive:\n`unlzma`, `tar`, `unzip`, `rpm`, `dpkg`, `man`\n\nAs shown in the [JFrog blogpost](https://jfrog.com/blog/unboxing-busybox-14-new-vulnerabilities-uncovered-by-claroty-and-jfrog/), the attack is most potent when the victim unzips a crafted zip archive, since there are no special requirements on the unzipped filename and the leaked data can be archived back into the original zip archive.",
